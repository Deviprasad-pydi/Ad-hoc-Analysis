# AtliQ Hardware Ad-Hoc Analysis Project

AtliQ Hardwares is a fictional leading computer hardware producer in India with a global presence. The company is committed to leveraging data analytics to drive smart, data-informed decisions.


**Challenge:**



AtliQ Hardwares identified a gap in their ability to make quick, smart data-informed decisions. To bridge this gap, they aimed to expand their data analytics team by hiring data analysts proficient in both technical and soft skills. Tony Sharma, their Data Analytics Director, devised a SQL challenge to evaluate these skills.



**My Task:**



As a hypothetical applicant for this role, I was tasked with:



* Reviewing the `ad-hoc-requests.pdf`, which contained 10 ad hoc business requests requiring insights.

* Writing and executing SQL queries to answer these requests.

* Creating Power BI visualizations to showcase these insights.



**My Approach:**



1.  **Data Extraction with SQL:**

    * Utilized MySQL to write and execute queries, extracting the necessary data to address each business request.

2.  **Data Visualization with Power BI:**

    * Leveraged Power BI to create clear and compelling visualizations of the query outputs, facilitating easy interpretation of the insights.

3.  **Actionable Insights:**

    * Derived actionable insights from the visualizations to support data-driven decision-making.


**Files in this Repository:**

* `ad-hoc-requests.pdf`: Document containing the 10 ad hoc business requests.

* `SQL Queries/`: File containing SQL scripts used to extract data.


**How to Use:**


* **SQL Queries:**

    * Navigate to the `SQL Queries/` folder.

    * Run the SQL scripts in your MySQL environment to extract the relevant data.

* **Power BI Visualizations:**

    * Open the Power BI files in Power BI Desktop to explore the data visualizations.

**Conclusion:**



This project demonstrates my ability to effectively handle complex data queries and translate findings into insightful visualizations using Power BI. It highlights my technical proficiency in SQL and my capability to present data in a manner that supports business intelligence.
